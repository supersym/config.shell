# Used to display markdown files inside the terminal with
# ANSI markup instead of HTML tags. No one thought of this
# earlier, this is a curses program written in C++ and
# you should use `make` to build the project. Do this from
# outside the directory like `make ../BSDmakefile` to keep
# source and build files separated nicely.
